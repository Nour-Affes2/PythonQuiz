# PythonQuiz
In this project, I created a quiz game using Python.
The player can choose a topic, according to their choice, they will be asked several questions which he will answer choosing from the answers available.
After each answer, the user will get a message of correct or wrong answer. After answering all the questions, the total of correct answers out of all the quiz will be displayed.
This project can be devided into 4 major functions :
  - prepare_questions(): this function loads the questions from the TOML file.
  - get_answers(): this functions gets the input answer from the user and handles the invalid answers.
  - ask_question() : prints the question, the alternatives and checks whether the answer is correct.
  - run_quiz(): runs the quiz.

I also used input control and added optional hints for the users.
The topics, questions and answers are saved in a separate TOML file.
In this project, I used different data structures such as :
  - Dictionaries
  - Lists
  - Sets

This project is a great way to practice imbricated data structures, input control and modular approach in programming.
